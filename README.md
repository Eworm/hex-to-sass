# About hex to sass

Hex to sass is an Atom package that transforms your hex colors to easy to use sass variables. The inspiration for this tool came from the color system in this medium post: https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/color-in-design-systems-a1c80f65fa3#.w5cudfcy9. I took this idea one step further and created this package to transform both greys and actual colors.

For people who don't use Atom I've built this site which does the same thing: http://woutmager.nl/fiftyshades/
